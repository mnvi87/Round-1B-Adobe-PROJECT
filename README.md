# Round 1B – Persona-Driven Document Intelligence  
## Theme: “Connect What Matters — For the User Who Matters”

This project contains a Python file `main1b.py`.
To run the project, first install the required packages using: `pip install PyMuPDF numpy scikit-learn sentence-transformers langdetect`. 
Then run the script using: `python main1b.py`. It will ask for PDF file paths and continue to take inputs until you type `done`. After that, it will process the documents based on the persona and their job-to-be-done, and display the most relevant sections in the terminal.

Files included:  
- `main1b.py` – main script  
- `README.md` – project instructions
